                <p>Initially, Yoga was imparted by the Adiyogi (the first yogi), Shiva, over 15,000 years ago. It was
                    Adiyogi who introduced to humanity the idea that one can evolve beyond one’s present level of
                    existence. <!-- He poured his knowing into the legendary Sapta Rishis, or seven sages, who took the
                    tremendous possibility offered by the yogic science to various parts of the world, including Asia,
                    ancient Persia, northern Africa, and South America. It is this fundamental yet sophisticated science
                    of elevating human consciousness that is the source of the world’s spiritual traditions, predating
                    religion by many thousands of years. Yoga is about attaining absolute Balance, piercing Clarity, and
                    an inexhaustible Exuberance. With this, you are immensely fit for life. -->
